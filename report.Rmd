## Section 1

Introduction to Section 1 and its key concepts. We will be looking at the last 5 years of student numbers.

### Figure 1: Student registrations from 2018 to 2022

```{r fig 1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.alt="this is where we add alt text", out.width="100%"}

fig_1 <- plot_ly(df_fig1,
                 x = ~years,
                 y = ~students,
                 type = "bar",
                 name = "Students",
                 marker = list(color = "#00205b"),
                 text = ~diff,
                 textposition = "outside",
                 hovertemplate = ~paste0(years, " : ", students)) %>% 
  layout(yaxis = list(title = ""),
         xaxis = list(title = "Year"))

fig_1 <- config(fig_1, displayModeBar = FALSE)

```

This is where we will add some commentary to explain the message conveyed by the chart.
